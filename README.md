## Installation

```bash
npx --package=@perseveranza-pets/dante -- create-dante-site my-site
cd my-site
npm install
dante dev
```

## Usage

### Creating pages and files

Simply create all file needed in the `build` function in `src/build/index.ts`. You can use any framework you want, the predefined one is React.

We strongly recommend to use the `createFile` function exported from `dante` to create file as it will take care of replacing `$hash` in the file name with the actual file hash.

The function must return an object containing the following properties:

- `cssConfig`: A `@unocss/core` configuration. This is the only required property.
- `css`: A css to be injected in each generated HTML page.

All properties can be (async) function that will be called for each page at runtime.

### Customizing the server

If you want to customize the local server, you can create a `setupServer` function inÂ `src/build/server.ts`. The function will receive a fastify server instance and build context.

The function can optionally return an object containing the following properties:

- `directory`: A subdirectory in the dist folder to server HTML files from.

### Exporting

Once you have done editing, you should execute `dante build`. The website will be exported in the `dist` folder.

### Adding commands to Dante

You can create a file `src/build/cli.ts` that should export a `setupCLI` function.
The function will received a [commander](https://npm.im/commander) program and a [pino](https://getpino.io) logger in order to modify the Dante CLI.

### Customize `create-dante-site`

You can create a file `src/build/create.ts` that should export a `createSetupCLI` function.
The function will received a [commander](https://npm.im/commander) program and a [pino](https://getpino.io) logger in order to modify the Dante CLI.
